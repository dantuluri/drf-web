# DRF Challenge

I utilized webpack and some basic math to create a circle.

With fourier transform, we split waves into sine waves. However, fourier transform doesn't split it into regular sine waves -- (available at [drf.suryad.com](https://drf.suryad.com)) we are creating 3D sine waves; complex sinusoids

This [general and surprising thing](http://www.paulgraham.com/sun.html) is a good way to uniquely make a circle appear on a page.


## Instructions
1. First slider can change how you look at the spirals (complex sinusoids), from the front or from the side
2. Second slider can change how big the spirals are (this was intended to be brodcasted over the socket.io room, but unfortunately I ran into numerous issues with webpack and socket.io, which I couldn't solve unless I scraped webpack entirely; note that I have tried socket.io on drf's website and it works well)


## Docker image (in case you want to run it):
